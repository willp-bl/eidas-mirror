eIDAS-Node Build 1.1 Content

This eIDAS release includes architectural and stability improvements.
Please be aware that the related documentation covering this release is not yet available but will be updated in the coming weeks.

This release contains the following improvements:
- definition of an abstraction and clear conformity of light Request/Response (in the module EIDAS-Light-Commons). These light objects (SAML agnostic) are designed to be used in the eIDAS-Node (SP to Connector) and also in the country specific modules (Proxy Service to IDP);
- definition of an abstraction and a clear conformity for the country specific modules (in the module EIDAS-SpecificCommunicationDefinition). With this abstraction the dependency with the SAML Engine is no longer needed in the country specific modules;
- improvements to the SAML Engine for complete independence and to able to be configured separately from the eIDAS-Node (metadata configuration, white list of signature and encryption algorithms);
- definition of an attribute registry used by the SAML Engine to provide clear definition, conformity of the attributes supported (configuration based) and enforcing validation;
- full coverage of the transliteration at the attribute and attribute registry level; and
- hardening to ensure immutability when necessary on the classes used in the SAML Engine (builder pattern).

The release also includes the following changes :

+ complete refactoring of the commons API to define a clear contract, prevent security and concurrency issues;
+ clear separation between Connector and Proxy Service;

+ definition of a clear contract of the SAML Engine API;
+ opening and definition of the SAML Engine ExtensionProcessorInterface, allowing extensibility to other SAML protocols (e.g. eIDAS, STORK etc.);
+ definition and declaration of a clear contract of the methods used in the Specific module;
+ dynamic configuration for properties used by the SAML Engine, these properties have been extracted from the eIDAS-Node general configuration and allow a more granular configuration (eidas.xml, eidas-specific.xml);
+ implementation of the minimum data set validation based on the attribute registry;
+implementation of a stable light-weight abstraction layer, exposed as an API and shipped as a library, on top of the OpenSAML library, which would wrap up all the low-level SAML boilerplate code;
+ implementation of two namespaces http://eidas.europa.eu/attributes/naturalperson and http://eidas.europa.eu/attributes/legalperson; and
+ remote code execution during object deserialization correction - upgrade the dependency version to commons-collection 3.2.2.

N.B. For compatibility, some APIs  from 1.0.2 have been kept from previous unofficial releases but declared as deprecated. They could disappear in a future release, replaced by the new already provided implementation.


eIDAS Node Build 1.0.2 Content

This intermediary release includes architectural and stability improvements (documentation not updated).
The tested applications servers are Tomcat, GlassFish and WebLogic.
This release provides an end-to-end sample of the happy path of a citizen's identification with a complete refactoring of the SAML Engine.

This refactoring covered:
- defining an abstraction and clear conformity of light Request/Response (in the module EIDAS-Light-Commons). These light objects (SAML agnostic) are designed to be used in the eIDAS-Node and also in the country specific modules;
- defining an abstraction and a clear conformity for the country specific modules (in the module EIDAS-SpecificCommunicationDefinition). With this abstraction the dependency with the SAML Engine is no longer needed in the country specific modules;
- defining an attribute registry used by the SAML Engine to provide clear definition and conformity of the attributes supported (configuration based); and
- hardening and ensuring immutability when necessary on the classes used in the SAML Engine (builder pattern).

eIDAS Node Build 1.0 Content

N.B: In a future release, it is intended to provide a major architectural improvement involving the Specific module.
The Specific module is inherited from the STORK PEPS Pilot 1 application. 
It provides a sample implementation of a Member State Specific module to customise the communication between the Identity Provider and the eIDAS-Node Proxy Service. 
Version 1.0 does not contain any improvements to or enhancements of the Specific module.
The architectural improvements of the Specific module will:
- Provide abstraction and a correct placeholder for the Member State's specific implementation; 
- Remove the dependency between the SAML Engine and the Specific module;
- Extend the Specific module to cover communications between Service Provider and eIDAS-Node Connector as well as the communications between Identity Provider and the eIDAS-Node Proxy Service. 

Version 1.0 includes the following:
+ Improvement of the software look and feel; 
+ Renaming of the STORK references to eIDAS terminology;
+ Modifications of the eIDAS-Node related to the technical specification:
                Parametrisation of the signing certificate of the metadata;
                Verification of the metadata expiration when processing it from the cache;
                Check the certificate validity on metadata generation, no metadata published if certificate expired;
                Suppression of EXACT implementation of the LoA (Level of Assurance); 
                Support sector specific attributes;
                Disable the support for STORK1 message format;
                Change of message format (namespace from "stork" to "eidas").
+ Modification in the sample SP-IDP and AP:
                Support eIDAS LoA  in the SP and IDP;
                Support eIDAS attributes;
                Extend eIDAS compliance to include communication between SP and the eIDAS-Node;
Extend eIDAS compliance to include communication between IDP and the eIDAS-Node;
                Improvement of the sample Service Provider to show the decrypted assertion.
                
+ Security : Update of third party libraries to the latest version(Bouncycastle-XMLSec-XML Santuario-Xalan-Commons-httpClient); 
+ Migration from Maven 2 to Maven 3;
+ provide new sample of eIDAS Keystore (double key + metadata signature) provided for each  binary.
                
List of conformance documents and requirements:
- eIDAS Interoperability Architecture v1.0
- eIDAS Message Format v1.0
- eIDAS SAML Attribute Profile v1.0
- eIDAS - Crypto Requirements for the Interop Framework v1.0

eIDAS Node Build 0.9 Content

Version 0.9

+ Add a feature selector enforcing eIDAS regulation compliance (when set to true);
+ Support of eIDAS compliant message format (eIDAS Technical Specifications);
+ Extension of eIDAS metadata (eIDAS Technical Specifications);
+ Security improvements:
    Strengthen browser cache weakness: add no-cache policy in the HTTP response header;
    Reflected Cross-site scripting mitigation: sanitisation of displayed values;
+ Removal of Middleware plugin;
+ Extension of the sample applications (SP, IDP, AP) to provide a sample of use of the eIDAS regulation features.
